  title: Who is Apollon 
  description: >
    Apollon’s strategy is to become the proven global medical cannabis company licenced to develop full spectrum formulations based on real life clinical patient data.


    It aims to create a globally recognised brand synonymous with quality, consistent potency on a range of products for a variety of conditions within the medical cannabis space.


    Apollon is a fully licensed, fully regulated medical cannabis company working with full spectrum oils inclusive of THC. The company plans, using its own formulations, to develop medicines for conditions that afflict humans in the modern world.


    Apollon Formularies will through its subsidiary Apollon Formularies Jamaica Ltd (a fully licensed full spectrum medical cannabis company), develop, market, distribute and sell full spectrum (inclusive of THC) products in the legal hemp and medical cannabis industry.  It is currently producing pharmaceutical, neutraceutical and other medical cannabis related products, including 3D printed sublingual, suppositories and capsules. Apollon Formularies was established to advance the current significant commercial opportunities in the legal medical cannabis markets globally.


    Apollon Formularies Jamaica Limited (“AFJ”) is licensed to operate at the Federal level in Jamaica and hold the following licences and approvals:  


    * Human Research & Development

    * Cultivate cannabis (“Tier 1”)

    * Retail dispensary license  

    * Retail Therapeutic Distribution
    
    * Tier 2 Extraction processing facility for 200 sq./m
    
    * “Tier 3” Conditional Cultivation approval expected Q1 2020

    * Conditional transport approval 


    Together these licences create a vertically integrated full spectrum (inclusive of THC) medical cannabis company both in Jamaica and to the international market via legal export from Jamaica to countries where the law allows import of medical cannabis products.
