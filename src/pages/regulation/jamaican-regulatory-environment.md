    The Cannabis Licensing Authority (CLA), an agency of the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, Agriculture and Fisheries, was established in 2015 under the Dangerous Drug (Amendment) Act, (DDA) with a specific role to establish and regulate Jamaica’s legal ganja and hemp industry.


    **Regulatory regime applicable to AFJ’s operations in Jamaica**


    Regarding the medical cannabis industry in Jamaica, the Dangerous Drug Act (DDA Act) Amendment of 2015 (Amended DDA), which came into operation on the 15th day of April, 2015, principally gives the Cannabis Licensing Authority (CLA), which operates under the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, Agriculture and Fisheries (MICAF), the power to issue licences, permits and authorizations, as may be appropriate, for the handling of hemp and marijuana (ganja) for medical, therapeutic or scientific purposes. Specifically, the CLA regulates the use, cultivation, processing, importation, exportation, transit, manufacture, sale, possession and distribution of hemp and marijuana for medicinal purposes, including research, clinical trials, therapy and treatment and the manufacture of nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals. The CLA is also charged with monitoring and otherwise regulating persons who have been issued licences, permits and authorizations and is specifically mandated to ensure that regulations do not contravene Jamaica’s international obligations. The CLA is comprised of representatives from several Ministries that are engaged with issues relating to ganja, the Attorney General’s Department, the National Council on Drug Abuse, academia, civil society groups and other non-governmental community-based and faith-based organizations.


    As a matter of principle, the Jamaican government, and by extension the CLA, is strongly against the use or handling of marijuana by children, teenagers, adolescents and at-risk adults. As part of its efforts to ensure the protection of such groups, the CLA is directed to work with the National Council on Drug Abuse (NCDA) to educate at-risk groups about the potential negative effects of the drug, and the Jamaican government funds programs administered by the NCDA. Accordingly, the Amended DDA authorized the Minister of Finance to direct that a percentage of the revenues earned from issuing licences, permits and authorizations relating to ganja and hemp be used for:
  list: >

     * Strengthening the capacity and programs of the NCDA

     * Strengthening Jamaica’s mental health institutions

     * Funding scientific and medical research into ganja and hemp

     * Supporting the regulatory arrangements of the CLA
