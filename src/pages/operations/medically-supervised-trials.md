    Apollon’s Jamaica’s Research and Development (Experimental) Licence allows the company to perform medically supervised trials overseen by the Jamaican Ministry of Health in addition to the medical team at Doc’s Place Wellness Centre.


    **STRATEGY**


    Apollon’s fully licensed full spectrum framework gives the company unrivalled ability to perform medically supervised trials. Apollon is one of a handful of companies worldwide able to do this.


    Jamaica’s regulations mean that Apollon’s clinical human trials can be conducted using its own cannabis-based formulations along with placebo’s to revealing the medicine’s efficacy. Formulations are, and will continue to be, patented.
