Apollon Formularies commenced treating of patients on Thursday 1st August, 2019, to coincide with Emancipation Day and the Dream Weekend, an annual entertainment event in Negril.

The facility which will have its official opening on Friday 25th October, 2019, is a joint venture between Doc’s Place International Inc., an international health and wellness resort and Apollon Formularies Jamaica Limited. It is located at Doc’s Place, Hotel and Resort Centre in Negril’s West End.

Key note speaker for the opening will be the Minister of Commerce, Industry, Agriculture and Fisheries, Hon. Audley Shaw.

CEO of Doc’s Place and a director of Apollon Formularies Jamaica, Ltd., Stephen D. Barnhill, MD, said, “This strategic relationship provides patients worldwide with the opportunity to receive world-class medical cannabis treatments provided by licensed physicians with special expertise in treating with medical cannabis-based pharmaceuticals in a safe, professional, medical and legal environment.”

He quoted the noted Greek physician, Hippocrates, the patron of medicine, as saying, “Healing is a matter of time, but it is sometimes also a matter of opportunity.”

The goal of the Medical Cannabis Therapy Centre is to provide an environment that enhances the quality of life for those being served. It is modelled after treatment centres, spas, resorts, and hotels that provide hospitality-oriented services in combination with personal care and well-being services.
